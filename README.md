# PASSWORD - SAFE

I have always been a fan of cryptograhy, and ever since watching the movie: The imitation game, I have been curious to know more about this. This project was the perfect opportunity for me to do some research and look at all the cool stuff we can do around cryptograhy. This project which I have named PASSWORD-SAFE, uses two significant libraries: Bcrypt and ofxdat gui. The bcrypt library was used to generate a hash from the password entered by the user. Since I found bcrypt is a very confusing library, to make things simpler and more intuitive, I made a header file, where I accumulated all the important and relevant code for the numerous header files in the bcrypt library, and also added a few things to it, to make it suitable for my program. I used ofxdat gui to make the interface which I have tried to keep very simple and obvious. This project prompts the user to enter a password, which it then hashes using the bcrypt library, and then stores the hashed password in a text file. The user can then check whether it is properly encrypted by comparing the hash with the password entered. 
If the hashes match, then the user is directed back to the home screen where he originally set the password. This is how we can tell that the encryption was successful.
